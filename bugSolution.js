The solution involves correcting the import order to ensure that components are imported before being used. 

```javascript
// Correct import order
import ComponentA from './ComponentA';
import ComponentB from './ComponentB';

function ComponentA() {
  return <ComponentB/>;
}
```

For larger projects, consider using lazy loading to improve performance and prevent this type of error.  Lazy loading ensures components are loaded on demand rather than upfront.
