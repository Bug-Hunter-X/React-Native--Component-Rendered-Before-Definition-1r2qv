This error occurs when you try to use a component before it's been defined. This often happens when importing components in the wrong order or when using a component before it's been fully rendered.  For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect import order
import ComponentB from './ComponentB';
import ComponentA from './ComponentA';

// ComponentA uses ComponentB, but ComponentB is imported after ComponentA
function ComponentA() {
  return <ComponentB/>;
}
```

In this scenario, React will try to render `<ComponentB/>` inside `ComponentA` before `ComponentB` is fully defined and available, resulting in the error.
